# Introduction
[The Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) (MDL) from Google is a really great thing if
you want to create semantic websites with nice looking elements that also fit for mobile devices.

But sooner or later you may face the problem that the components provided by the MDL are not covers all your needs. 
For example you will need a component that works similar to your phones contact form when you deal with multiple similar data, 
like phone numbers: add and remove, change type, set value. Or you need a file uploader that has the style of the MDL. And so on.
 
This library provides different components as extensions to the official MDL library.
