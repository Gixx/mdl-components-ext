# Introduction
[The Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) (MDL) from Google is a really great thing if
you want to create semantic websites with nice looking elements that also fit for mobile devices.

But sooner or later you may face the problem that the components provided by the MDL are not covers all your needs. And 
maybe you will need a component that works similar to your phones contact form when you deal with multiple similar data, 
like phone numbers: add and remove, change type, set value.

This is a typical key-value list. And that is what I provide here for you. A full MDL-compatible component build with 
the well-known simplicity of other MDL tools.

Please check the 'src/kvl' folder for the component and for demos.
